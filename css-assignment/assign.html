			<h2>CHICKEN</h2>
			<section>
			Chicken curry is a common delicacy in South Asia, Southeast Asia, as well as in the Caribbean (where it is usually referred to as "curry chicken"). A typical South Asian curry consists of chicken stewed in an onion and tomato-based sauce, flavored with ginger, garlic, chili peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom and so on. Outside South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.

			<h2>BEEF</h2>
			<section>
			Beef bourguignon US /ˌbiːf ˌbʊərɡᵻnˈjɔːn/ or bœuf bourguignon (UK /ˌbɜːrf ˈbʊərɡᵻnjɔːn/;[1] French pronunciation: ​[bœf buʁ.ɡi.ɲɔ̃]), also called beef Burgundy, and bœuf à la Bourguignonne,[2] is a well-known, traditional French recipe.

The dish originates from the Burgundy region (in French, Bourgogne) which is in the east of present-day France, as do many other dishes such as coq au vin, escargot, persillé ham, oeufs en meurette, gougères, pain d'épices, etc.

It is a stew prepared with beef braised in red wine, traditionally red Burgundy, and beef broth, generally flavoured with garlic, onions and a bouquet garni, with pearl onions and mushrooms added towards the end of cooking.

Traditionally, the meat was larded with lardons, but modern beef is sufficiently tender and well-marbled, so this very time-consuming technique is rarely used any more. However, bacon cut into small cubes is still used to produce the initial cooking fat and added to the dish at the end.

			<h2>SUSHI</h2>
			<section>
			Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨?) is a food preparation originating in Japan, consisting of cooked vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi?) combined with other ingredients (ネタ neta?) such as raw seafood, vegetables and sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice (also referred to as shari (しゃり?) or sumeshi (酢飯?)).

Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients or are vegetarian. Raw fish (or occasionally other meat) sliced and served without rice is called "sashimi". Sushi is often served with pickled ginger (ガリ gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often made using daikon.
